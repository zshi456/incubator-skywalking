# Backend setup
First and most important thing is, SkyWalking backend startup behaviours are driven by `config/application.yml`.
Understood the setting file will help you to read this document.

## Startup script
Startup scripts are `/bin/oapService.sh`(.bat)

## application.yml
The core concept behind this setting file is, SkyWalking collector is based on pure modulization design. 
End user can switch or assemble the collector features by their own requirements.

So, in `application.yml`, there are three levels.
1. **Level 1**, module name. Meaning this module is active in running mode.
1. **Level 2**, provider name. Set the provider of the module.
1. **Level 3**. settings of the provider.

Example:
```yaml
core:
  default:
    restHost: 0.0.0.0
    restPort: 12800
    restContextPath: /
    gRPCHost: 0.0.0.0
    gRPCPort: 11800
```
1. **core** is the module.
1. **default** is the default implementor of core module.
1. `restHost`, `restPort`, ... `gRPCHost` are all setting items of the implementor.

At the same time, modules includes required and optional, the required modules provide the skeleton of backend,
even modulization supported pluggable, remove those modules are meanless. We highly recommend you don't try to
change APIs of those modules, unless you understand SkyWalking project and its codes very well.

List the required modules here
1. **Core**. Do basic and major skeleton of all data analysis and stream dispatch.
1. **Cluster**. Manage multiple backend instances in a cluster, which could provide high throughputs process
capabilities.
1. **Storage**. Make the analysis result persistence.
1. **Query**. Provide query interfaces to UI.

For **Cluster** and **Storage** have provided multiple implementors(providers), see **Cluster management**
and **Choose storage** documents in the [link list](#advanced-feature-document-link-list).

Also, several **receiver** modules are provided.
Receiver is the module in charge of accepting incoming data requests to backend. Most(all) provide 
service by some network(RPC) protocol, such as gRPC, HTTPRestful.  
The receivers have many different module names, you could
read **Set receivers** document in the [link list](#advanced-feature-document-link-list).

## Advanced feature document link list
After understand the setting file structure, you could choose your interesting feature document.
We recommend you to read the feature documents in our following order.

1. [Overriding settings](backend-setting-override.md) in application.yml is supported
1. [IP and port setting](backend-ip-port.md). Introduce how IP and port set and be used.
1. [Backend init mode startup](backend-init-mode.md). How to init the environment and exit graciously.
Read this before you try to initial a new cluster.
1. [Cluster management](backend-cluster.md). Guide you to set backend server in cluster mode.
1. [Deploy in kubernetes](backend-k8s.md). Guide you to build and use SkyWalking image, and deploy in k8s.
1. [Choose storage](backend-storage.md). As we know, in default quick start, backend is running with H2
DB. But clearly, it doesn't fit the product env. In here, you could find what other choices do you have.
Choose the one you like, we are also welcome anyone to contribute new storage implementor,
1. [Set receivers](backend-receivers.md). You could choose receivers by your requirements, most receivers
are harmless, at least our default receivers are. You would set and active all receivers provided.
1. Do [trace sampling](trace-sampling.md) at backend. This sample keep the metric accurate, only don't save some of traces
in storage based on rate.
1. Official [OAL scripts](../../guides/backend-oal-scripts.md). As you known from our [OAL introduction](../../concepts-and-designs/oal.md),
most of backend analysis capabilities based on the scripts. Here is the description of official scripts,
which helps you to understand which metric data are in process, also could be used in alarm.
1. [Alarm](backend-alarm.md). Alarm provides a time-series based check mechanism. You could set alarm 
rules targeting the analysis oal metric objects.
